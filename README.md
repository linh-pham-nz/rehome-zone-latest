# Rehome Zone

This is a personal project started during my time at Enspiral Dev Academy. It is a cat adoption website for 2 types of users: those who want to view cats available and those who want to rehome their cat(s). It features:

* A home page
* An external API (to retrieve cat facts)
* A database of current cats for adoption
* A form for rehoming cats


To get started:

```
git clone 
npm install # to install dependencies
npx knex migrate:latest # to migrate latest tables
npx knex seed:run # to seed the database
npm run dev # to start the dev server
```

You can find the server running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
